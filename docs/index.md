`Chess\Game` is the building block of the [PHP Chess Server](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-server). It is a wrapper for a chessboard object of type `Chess\Variant\Classical\Board` to play chess online actually. It is also used in the [Chess API](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-api) as well as in [command line](https://php-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/) (CLI) apps.

Variants:

- `Chess\Game::VARIANT_960`
- `Chess\Game::VARIANT_CAPABLANCA_80`
- `Chess\Game::VARIANT_CAPABLANCA_100`
- `Chess\Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL`

Modes:

- `Chess\Game:MODE_ANALYSIS`
- `Chess\Game:MODE_GM`
- `Chess\Game:MODE_FEN`
- `Chess\Game:MODE_PGN`
- `Chess\Game:MODE_PLAY`
- `Chess\Game:MODE_STOCKFISH`

Let's look at the methods available in the `Chess\Game` class through some examples. For further information please check out the tests in [tests/unit/GameTest.php](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/GameTest.php).

---

#### `public function play(string $color, string $pgn): bool`

The following code snippet starts a classical game in analysis mode and makes the first move in PGN format.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_ANALYSIS
);

$game->play('w', 'Nc3');
```

#### `public function playLan(string $color, string $uci): bool`

This one also starts a classical game in analysis mode making the first move in long algebraic notation instead.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_ANALYSIS
);

$game->playLan('w', 'b1c3');
```

#### `public function loadFen(string $fen): void`

Described next is how to start a classical game in FEN mode. After a FEN string is successfully loaded the game can be continued by making moves either in PGN or in long algebraic notation.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_FEN
);

$game->loadFen('rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 0 9');
$game->play('b', 'Bg7');
```

#### `public function loadPgn(string $movetext): void`

This is how to start a game in PGN mode. After a PGN movetext is successfully loaded the game can be continued by making moves either in PGN or in long algebraic notation.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_PGN
);

$game->loadPgn('1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6');
$game->play('w', 'e5');
```

#### `public function ai(array $options = [], array $params = []): ?object`

The code snippet below returns a computer generated response to the current position. It starts a classical chess game in grandmaster mode to then play `1.e4`.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_GM,
    __DIR__.'/../data/players.json'
);

$game->play('w', 'e4');

$ai = $game->ai();

print_r($ai);
```
```

        )

)
```

A `Chess\Game` object can also be started in Stockfish mode. If provided with a `.json` file on instantiation it'll try to respond with a grandmaster move first, if found in the file.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_STOCKFISH,
    __DIR__.'/../data/players.json'
);

$game->play('w', 'e4');

$ai = $game->ai(['Skill Level' => 9], ['depth' => 3]);

print_r($ai);
```
```

        )

)
```

The `players.json` file, which is an optional parameter, is to be generated with the command line tools available in the [Chess Data](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data) repository. The chess game can be started in Stockfish mode without any help from grandmasters.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_STOCKFISH
);

$game->play('w', 'e4');

$ai = $game->ai(['Skill Level' => 9], ['depth' => 3]);

print_r($ai);
```
```
stdClass Object
(
    [move] => d5
)
```

#### `public function state(): object`

Returns the state of the game in `stdClass` format.

```php
use Chess\Game;

$game = new Game(
    Game::VARIANT_CLASSICAL,
    Game::MODE_ANALYSIS
);

$state = $game->state();
```

`$state` is a PHP object with information about the game being played.

| Property          | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `turn`            | The current player's turn                           |
| `castlingAbility` | The castling ability in FEN format                  |
| `movetext`        | PGN movetext                                        |
| `fen`             | FEN string                                          |
| `isCheck`         | Checks out if the current player is in check        |
| `isMate`          | Checks out if the current player is checkmated      |
| `isStalemate`     | Checks out whether the current player is stalemated |

The properties of the  `$state` object are accessed this way:

```php
$game->state()->turn;
$game->state()->castlingAbility;
$game->state()->movetext;
$game->state()->fen;
$game->state()->isCheck;
$game->state()->isMate;
$game->state()->isStalemate;
```

#### `public function getBoard(): ClassicalBoard`

`Chess\Game` is a wrapper for an object of type `Chess\Variant\Classical\Board` and this method returns the underlying chessboard.
